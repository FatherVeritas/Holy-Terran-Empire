    <h2>About This World</h2>
 <p>  
It is the year 3500 AD. The Catholic Church has once more risen to her rightful primacy, and the Emperor of the Holy Terran Empire, 
united with the Pontifex of Rome, strives to bring the Light of Christ to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.
</p>
 
<p>
Ships cross the void at faster-than-light speeds through Etherspace.
Alien races- descendants of mankind seeded among the stars at the Astersion- await the Gospel, longing for redemption. 
Standing ever vigilant are the Ordo Militaris - religious-military orders of celibate warriors sworn to defend the galaxy. 
</p>

<p>
Yet even as the faith spreads, that ancient enemy of mankind, the Devil and Satan, ceaselessly sows discord, heresy, and rebellion among the peoples of the stars.
</p>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>Why?</h2>
	<p>
I am creating this world to rekindle vision in a world blinded by sin. In our present day, it seems every nation on Earth has been lulled into submission by an atheistic technocracy, ruled by power-hungry oligarchs, techno-sorcerers, and trillionaires hoarding unimaginable wealth. 
</p>
<p>
Even the ministers of God's Church, whose sacred duty it is to shepherd the souls entrusted to their care, seem at a complete loss for how to break these chains. The result is a humanity unable to rise from spiritual paralysis, unable to see beyond the walls of itsown atheistic rationalism. 
</p>

<p>
This project is a cry of defiance — the battle-standard of Christendom raised against the tyranny of godless men, hell-bent on replacing God with soulless machines. 
It is a vision of a future that could be: a future not enslaved by algorithms, but freed by Faith — faith in God and a burning Charity for mankind. 
This project aims to show man's future among the stars as one that remembers the forgotten wisdom of the ancients, the timeless truths of Holy Mother Church, and the luminous example of the Saints.
</p>
	
<p>
In so doing, the hope is that all who are presented with a future of this kind, will be stirred to remember the past - our own past, the past of Christendom, which 
far from being over and done and dead, is the very vehicle by which mankind TODAY will break his chains. This is what will propel us beyond the current moral decay and 
atheism and tyranny - a return to Faith in the living God, and a belief that He has hidden miracles within the fabric of His creation, waiting to be discovered by those who still dare to believe.
</p>

	  
<h2>Why Fiction?</h2>
	<p>
At the heart of this effort lies a deep conviction that all stories — every tale worth telling — is meant to convey God’s truth. 
When science fiction and fantasy are told with a moral order that aligns with the Eternal Law God, these so-called 
‘fairy tales’ become more real than any ‘realistic’ story which violates that order. 
	</p>
	<p>	
What is the story being told? What moral choices face our heroes? What dilemmas test their souls? What does the battle between good and evil teach us? How do we see ourselves in their triumphs and failures? Beneath imaginary worlds and impossible beings is the reality of human nature, the truth about virtue and vice, 
the eternal drama of the human heart. That is why people read stories — not to flee reality, but to see it more clearly. 
	</p>

	<p>
A modern tale set in the here and now, yet built on the lie that God does not exist, is far less true than a fable of dragons, elves, or distant stars that upholds His  moral order. A true fairy tale, far from being a departure from reality, reveals it's most important characteristic - that good is good, evil is evil, actions have consequences, virtue redeems, and the human soul longs for what is greater than itself. In any story worthy of the name, beneath the superficiality of appearances lies the concrete reality of God’s truth. 
	</p>

	<p>
And what greater story is there than the Bible — the fairy tale par excellence, written by the hand of the Master Storyteller Himself? 
When God became man, he did not condemn stories, but rather made use of them in parables, to teach us the most sublime truths of goodness and virtue.
Is it really a stretch to see that "In the Beginning" has as its counterpart "Once upon a time"? The beginning of any story worthy of te name is an invitation to sit down, and listen to the wisdom about to be shared. This indeed is what Christ Himself did, when He stood in boats, sat upon grassy hills, and indeed when He mounted the Cross — he was telling a story. Parables were His chosen instrument, a divine seal upon the storyteller’s art. </p>

<p>
This is the storyteller’s true vocation: to craft a vessel worthy of carrying truth. Story does more than merely tell us - they show us. Story gives shape to conviction, stirs both heart and soul, and delivers wisdom not as dry command, but as living experience. In this way, the true nature of fantasy and science fiction, far from being the false realities that Hollywood has portrayed them for years - are about the deepest reality. They must take their place as the parables of our time.
