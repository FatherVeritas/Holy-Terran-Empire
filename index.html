    <h2>About This World</h2>
 <p>  
It is the year 3500 AD. The Catholic Church has once more risen to her rightful primacy, and the Emperor of the Holy Terran Empire, 
united with the Pontifex of Rome, strives to bring the Light of Christ to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.
</p>
 
<p>
Ships cross the void at faster-than-light speeds through Etherspace.
Alien races- descendants of mankind seeded among the stars at the Astersion- await the Gospel, longing for redemption. 
Standing ever vigilant are the Ordo Militaris - religious-military orders of celibate warriors sworn to defend the galaxy. 
</p>

<p>
Yet even as the faith spreads, that ancient enemy of mankind, the Devil and Satan, ceaselessly sows discord, heresy, and rebellion among the peoples of the stars.
</p>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>WHY?</h2>
	<p>
I created this world to rekindle vision in a world blinded by sin. Every nation on Earth has been lulled into submission by an atheistic technocracy, ruled by power-hungry oligarchs, techno-sorcerers, and trillionaires hoarding wealth unthinkable. 
</p>

<p>
Even the shepherds of the Church seem at a loss for how to break these chains, and the result in a humanity unable to rise from their spiritual paralysis. 
</p>

<p>
This project is my cry of defiance — a battle-standard of Christendom raised against the tyranny of godless men, hell-bent on replacing God with soulless machines. 
It is a vision of a future that could be: a future not enslaved by cold, calculating AI, but set free by Faith — faith in God and a burning Charity for mankind. 
It paints a picture of mankind's future among the stars as one that remembers the forgotten wisdom of the ancients, the timeless truths of Holy Mother Church, and the luminous example of the Saints.
</p>
	
<p>
This is how mankind will break its chains. 
This is what will propel us beyond the stars— not the dead-end of an atheistic technology, but a return to Faith in the living God, 
and a belief that He has hidden miracles within the fabric of His creation, waiting to be discovered by those who still dare to believe."
</p>

	  
<h2>A Science Fiction Story? Really?</h2>
	<p>
At the heart of this world I’m building lies the deep conviction that all stories — every tale worth telling — is meant to convey God’s truth. When science fiction and fantasy are told with a moral order that aligns with the Eternal Law God has written into the universe, these so-called ‘fairy tales’ become more real than any ‘realistic’ story which violates God's order. </p>

<p>
What is the story being told? Why do we care? What moral choices stand before our heroes? What dilemmas test their souls? How do their choices echo back upon them? What does the battle between good and evil teach us? How do we see ourselves in their triumphs and failures? Beneath imaginary worlds and impossible beings is the reality of human nature, the truth about virtue and vice, the eternal drama of the human heart. That is why people read stories — not to flee reality, but to see it more clearly. </p>

<p>
A modern tale set in the here and now, yet built on the lie that God does not exist, or that good can be evil and evil good, is far less true than a fable of dragons, elves, or distant stars that upholds the moral order established by God. A true fairy tale, far from being a departure from reality, reveals it's most important characteristic - that good is good, evil is evil, actions have consequences, virtue redeems, and the human soul longs for what is greater than itself. In any story worthy of the name, beneath the superficialities of costume and appearance lies the concrete reality of God’s truth written in the human heart. </p>

<p>
And what greater story is there than the Bible — the fairy tale par excellence, written by the hand of the Master Storyteller Himself? JRR Tolkien once wrote "The Gospels contain a story of a larger kind which embraces all the essence of fairy-stories. Christ is the true Myth become Fact, the story that every other story longs for and points toward." God, in His wisdom, shows us how to tell stories, in telling His with real people, real events, and real consequences that echo through eternity. </p>

<p>
Is it really a stretch to see that the counterpart of "In the Beginning" is "Once upon a time"?  Any time we begin a story, we ought to begin in a similar way. It is an invitation to others, to sit down, and listen to the wisdom we have to share. This is what Christ Himself did, anytime He stood on boats, sat upon grassy hills, and even when He mounted the Cross — he was telling a story. Parables were His chosen instrument, a divine seal upon the storyteller’s art. </p>

<p>
This is the storyteller’s true vocation: to craft a vessel worthy of carrying truth. Story shows us, not merely tells us. It gives shape to conviction, stirs both heart and soul, and delivers wisdom not as dry command, but as living experience. In this way, fantasy and science fiction, far from being imaginary fantasies apart from reality - are about the deepest reality. They are the parables of our time.
