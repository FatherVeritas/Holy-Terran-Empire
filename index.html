    <h2>About This World</h2>
	<p>  
It is the year 3500 AD. The Catholic Church has once again risen to her rightful primacy, and the Holy Terran Empire – Sacrum Terranum Imperium – is established not only on Earth, but across the stars. Ruled by the Emperor, and guided by the Pontifex of Rome, the Imperium seeks to bring the light of Christ to the furthest reaches of the galaxy, thus to sanctify the cosmos it was destined to inherit.
	</p>
	<p>
Thousands of worlds teem with rational life, known as exohumans — so called for their shared origin with the human race on Earth.
In a primordial dispersion during the age of Noah, God sent forth human seed among the stars, there to await their redemption in Christ. 
While many races and nations have already been saved, untold thousands more still languish in darkness and idolatry.  
	</p>
	<p>
The spacefaring vessels of this new Christendom sail not upon the high seas, but in a mysterious dimension known as Etherspace.
In this realm of metaphysical substance, spacecraft can travel up to a thousand times the speed of light, by attuning themselves to the proper resonant frequencies.
Thus the ships of the Imperium swiftly carry the Gospel across the stars, through the medium in which the resurrected body will one day travel. 
	</p>
	<p>
Standing ever ready to defend the Kingdom of Christ and the faithful who serve Him are the Ordo Militaris: warrior-monks bound by solemn vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.
Across a battlefield spanning Earth and heaven, these consecrated soldiers wage war with both sword and Rosary.
Whether confronting principalities and powers in the spiritul realm, or alien technocracies in the Scorpio Constelli, the Battlemonks stand resolute - psalms on their lips and weapons in their hands. 
	</p>
	<p>
It is a time of glory and danger, of salvation and peril.
Yet even as the standard of Christ rises over the galaxy, and the Gospel is recited in alien tongues, that ancient enemy of mankind, the Devil and Satan, ceaselessly sows discord, heresy, and rebellion.
Will this new Christendom endure — or will the Devil succeed in breaking it once again? 
	</p>	
  <div class="content">


	  
	  
<h2>Why?</h2>
	<p>
This world is created to rekindle vision in an age blinded by sin.
In our present day, it seems nearly the whole world is held in the grip of an atheistic technocracy, hell-bent on replacing God with machine.  
	<p>
	</p>
Even the ministers of God's Church, entrusted with the sacred duty of evangelizing the world, seem unable to provide a vision of the future in which Christ holds any significance. The result is a humanity unable to rise from spiritual paralysis, unable to see beyond the dead ends of relativism and hedonism.
	<p>
	</p>
This project seeks to provide a battle-standard for those who wish to rally around Christ, by providing a vision of a future that could be, in which mankind remembers the perennial truths of Holy Mother Church, the wisdom of the ancients, and the example of the Saints.
	<p>
	</p>
Our hope is that modern man will be stirred to remember his own past- the past of Christendom, which built the modern world, and which, far from being dead and buried, has the power to propel man into the future - a future filled with Faith in the living God, and a belief that He has hidden miracles within the fabric of His creation, waiting to be discovered by those who still dare to believe.
	</p>
  
	  
    <h2>Why Fiction?</h2>
	<p>
At the heart of this effort lies the deep conviction that every story worth telling exists to communicate Truth. Not merely the observable facts of the physical world, but the deeper moral and spiritual realities of good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice. 
	</p>
	<p>
A modern tale that denies the existence of God, or the reality of good and evil, is less grounded in truth than a mythic tale filled with magic or wonders, yet faithful to the moral order of creation. True fairy tales do not obscure reality, but illuminate it. They affirm that good is good, evil is evil, that actions have consequences, that virtue leads to joy, and that the human soul is made for something beyond itself.
	</p>
	<p>
A truly great story does not depend on its setting but on whether it reflects the truth of the human soul. What moral choices confront the characters? What trials test their integrity? What do their triumphs and failures reveal about ourselves? Beneath swords and starships, elves and aliens, lies the eternal drama of the human heart: the longing for justice, the struggle with temptation, the hope for redemption. This is why we turn to stories — not to escape reality, but to see it more clearly.
	</p>
	<p>
And what greater witness to the power of story do we have than Christ Himself? When God became man, He taught through parables, standing in boats or sitting on hillsides, and his stories were not told as entertainment, but as Revelation, imparting Divine truths to mankind. “In the beginning” and “Once upon a time” are not so far apart: both open the door to a world in which Truth can be encountered through narrative.
	</p>
	<p>
This is the storyteller’s vocation: to craft a vessel worthy of carrying truth. Stories do not simply inform - they transform. They give shape to conviction, stir the heart, and awaken longing. In this light, fantasy and science fiction, rather than being dismissed as escapist, should be seen as instruments of spiritual warfare, used for the conversion of souls. It is time for these genres to step forward, not as the hollow diversions that modern culture has made them, but as the parables of our age, bringing God's wisdom to a world starved for Truth.
