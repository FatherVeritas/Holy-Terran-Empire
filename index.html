    <h2>About This World</h2>
 <p>  
It is the year 3500 AD. The Catholic Church has once more risen to her rightful primacy, and the Emperor of the Holy Terran Empire, 
united with the Pontifex of Rome, strives to bring the Light of Christ to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.
</p>
 
<p>
Ships cross the void at faster-than-light speeds through Etherspace.
Alien races- descendants of mankind seeded among the stars at the Astersion- await the Gospel, longing for redemption. 
Standing ever vigilant are the Ordo Militaris - religious-military orders of celibate warriors sworn to defend the galaxy. 
</p>

<p>
Yet even as the faith spreads, that ancient enemy of mankind, the Devil and Satan, ceaselessly sows discord, heresy, and rebellion among the peoples of the stars.

    <h2>Why?</h2>
	<p>
At the heart of this effort lies a deep conviction: the purpose of every story worth telling is to communicate Truth—not merely the observable facts of the physical world, but the deeper moral and spiritual realities of good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice. These are the truths that often go unseen in daily life, yet they are the very substance of the human condition. When science fiction and fantasy are built upon the moral order established by God, these so-called "fairy tales" become more real than any modern narrative that denies that order.
	</p>
	<p>
A truly great story does not depend on setting, whether in dragon caves or distant galaxies, but on whether it reflects the truth about the human soul. What moral choices confront the characters? What trials test their integrity? What do their triumphs and failures reveal about ourselves? Beneath the swords and starships, the elves and alien empires, lies the eternal drama of the human heart: the longing for justice, the struggle with temptation, the hope for redemption. This is why we turn to stories—not to escape reality, but to perceive it more clearly.
	</p>
	<p>
A modern tale that denies the existence of God, the reality of good and evil, or the grandeur and depravity possible in the human soul, is far less grounded in truth than a mythic tale filled with magic or wonders that upholds the moral fabric of creation. True fairy tales do not obscure reality—they illuminate it. They affirm that good is good, evil is evil, actions have consequences, virtue leads to joy, and the human soul is made for something beyond itself.
	</p>
	<p>
And what greater witness to the power of story do we have than Christ Himself? When God became man, He taught through parables. He stood in boats, sat on hillsides, and spoke in stories—not as entertainment, but as revelation. These parables were His chosen method, stamped with divine authority. Through them, He conveyed the highest truths about love, mercy, justice, and the kingdom of God. “In the beginning” and “Once upon a time” are not so far apart: both open the door to a world of meaning, a world in which Truth is encountered through narrative.
	</p>
	<p>
This is the storyteller’s vocation: to craft a vessel worthy of carrying truth. Stories do not simply inform—they transform. They give shape to conviction, stir the heart, awaken longing, and deliver wisdom not as dry instruction but as living experience. In this light, fantasy and science fiction—long dismissed as escapist—are revealed to be instruments of profound insight. It is time for these genres to step forward, not as distractions from reality, but as the parables of our age.</p>
