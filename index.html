    <h2>About This World</h2>
It is the year 3500 AD. The Catholic Church has once more risen to her rightful primacy, and the Emperor of the Holy Terran Empire, 
united with the Pontifex of Rome, strives to bring the Light of Christ to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.
</p>
 
<p>
Ships cross the void at faster-than-light speeds through Etherspace.
Alien races- descendants of mankind seeded among the stars at the Astersion- await the Gospel, longing for redemption. 
Standing ever vigilant are the Ordo Militaris - religious-military orders of celibate warriors sworn to defend the galaxy. 
</p>

<p>
Yet even as the faith spreads, that ancient enemy of mankind, the Devil and Satan, ceaselessly sows discord, heresy, and rebellion among the peoples of the stars.
</p>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>WHY?</h2>
	<p>
I created this world to rekindle vision in a world blinded by sin. Every nation on Earth has been lulled into submission by an atheistic technocracy, ruled by power-hungry oligarchs, techno-sorcerers, and trillionaires hoarding wealth unthinkable. </p>

<p>
Even the shepherds of the Church seem at a loss for how to break these chains, and the result in a humanity unable to rise from their spiritual paralysis. </p>

<p>
This project is my cry of defiance — a battle-standard of Christendom raised against the tyranny of godless men, hell-bent on replacing God with soulless machines. It is a vision of a future that could be: a future not enslaved by cold, calculating AI, but set free by Faith — faith in God and a burning Charity for mankind. It paints a picture of mankind's future among the stars as one that remembers the forgotten wisdom of the ancients, the timeless truths of Holy Mother Church, and the luminous example of the Saints.

<p>
This is how mankind will break its chains. This is what will propel us beyond the stars— not the dead-end of an atheistic technology, but a return to Faith in the living God, and a belief that He has hidden miracles within the fabric of His creation, waiting to be discovered by those who still dare to believe."
