    <h2>About This World</h2>
	<p>  
It is the year 3500 AD. The Catholic Church has once again risen to her rightful primacy, and the Holy Terran Empire – Sacrum Terranum Imperium – is established not only on Earth, but across the stars. 
Ruled by the Emperor, and guided by the Pontifex of Rome, the Imperium seeks to bring the light of Christ to the furthest reaches of the galaxy, thus to sanctify the cosmos it was destined to inherit.
	</p>
	<p>
Thousands of worlds teem with rational life, known as exohumans — so called for their shared origin with the human race on Earth.
In a primordial dispersion during the age of Noah, known as the Astersion, God sent forth human seed among the stars, there to await their redemption in Christ. 
While many races and nations have already been saved, untold thousands more still languish in darkness and idolatry.  
	</p>
	<p>
The vessels of this new Christendom sail not upon the high seas, but through a mysterious dimension known as Etherspace.
In this realm of metaphysical substance, spacecraft can travel up to a thousand times the speed of light by attuning themselves to the resonant frequencies of the Ether.
It is thus the ships of the Imperium swiftly carry the Gospel across the stars to those ancient races, lost in space and time. 
	</p>
	<p>
Standing ever ready to defend the Kingdom of Christ and the faithful who serve Him are the Ordo Militaris—warrior-monks bound by solemn vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.
Across a battlefield spanning heaven and Earth, these consecrated soldiers wage war with both sword and Rosary.
Whether confronting principalities and powers in the spiritul realm, or alien technocracies in the Scorpio Constelli, the Ordo Militaris stand resolute - psalms on their lips, weapons in their hands. 
	</p>
	<p>
It is a time of glory and danger, of salvation and peril.
Yet even as the standard of Christ rises over the galaxy, and the Gospel is recited in alien tongues, that ancient enemy of mankind, the Devil and Satan, ceaselessly sows discord, heresy, and rebellion among the peoples of the stars.
Will this new Christendom endure — or will the Devil succeed in breaking it once again? 
	</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
	<p>
I am creating this world to rekindle vision in a world blinded by sin.
In our present day, it seems every nation on Earth has been lulled into submission by an atheistic technocracy, ruled by power-hungry oligarchs, techno-sorcerers, and trillionaires hoarding unimaginable wealth. 
	<p>
	</p>
Even the ministers of God's Church, whose sacred duty it is to shepherd the souls entrusted to their care, seem at a complete loss for how to break these chains.
The result is a humanity unable to rise from spiritual paralysis, unable to see beyond the walls of its own atheistic rationalism. 
	<p>
	</p>
This project is a cry of defiance, the battle-standard of Christendom raised against the tyranny of godless men, hell-bent on replacing God with soulless machines.
It is a vision of a future that could be: a future not enslaved by algorithms, but freed by Faith, faith in God and a burning charity for mankind.
This project aims to show man's future as one that remembers the timeless truths of Holy Mother Church, the forgotten wisdom of the ancients, and the luminous example of the Saints.
	<p>
	</p>
The hope is that all who are presented with this vision of the future will be stirred to remember the past - our own past, the past of Christendom, which far from being dead and buried, is the very vehicle by which mankind TODAY will break his chains.
This is what will propel us beyond the current moral decay of atheism and tyranny - a return to Faith in the living God, and a belief that He has hidden miracles within the fabric of His creation, waiting to be discovered by those who still dare to believe.
	</p>





	  
	  
    <h2>Why Fiction?</h2>
	<p>
At the heart of this effort lies a deep conviction: every story worth telling exists to communicate Truth.
Not merely the observable facts of the physical world, but the deeper moral and spiritual realities - good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice.
Though often obscured in daily life, thse truths are the very substance of the human condition.
When science fiction and fantasy are built upon the moral order established by God, these so-called "fairy tales" become more real than any modern narrative that denies that order.
	</p>
	<p>
A truly great story does not depend on its setting - whether in dragon caves or distant galaxies - but on whether it reflects the truth of the human soul.
What moral choices confront the characters? What trials test their integrity? What do their triumphs and failures reveal about ourselves?
Beneath sword and starship, elf and alien, lies the eternal drama of the human heart: the longing for justice, the struggle with temptation, the hope for redemption.
This is why we turn to stories—not to escape reality, but to perceive it more clearly.
	</p>
	<p>
A modern tale that denies the existence of God, the reality of good and evil, or the grandeur and depravity possible in the human soul, is far less grounded in truth than a mythic tale filled with magic or wonders, yet faithful to the moral order of creation.
True fairy tales do not obscure reality, but illuminate it.
They affirm that good is good, evil is evil, actions have consequences, virtue leads to joy, and the human soul is made for something beyond itself.
	</p>
	<p>
And what greater witness to the power of story do we have than Christ Himself? When God became man, He taught through parables.
He stood in boats, sat on hillsides, and spoke in stories — not as entertainment, but as revelation.These parables were His chosen method, stamped with divine authority. 
Through them, He conveyed the highest truths about love, mercy, justice, and the kingdom of God.
“In the beginning” and “Once upon a time” are not so far apart: both open the door to a world of God's creation, a world in which Truth is encountered through narrative.
	</p>
	<p>
This is the storyteller’s vocation: to craft a vessel worthy of carrying truth. Stories do not simply inform - they transform. They give shape to conviction, stir the heart, and awaken longing. They deliver wisdom not as dry instruction, but as a living experience.
In this light, fantasy and science fiction—long dismissed as escapist—are revealed to be instruments of profound insight.
It is time for these genres to step forward, not as the hollow diversions that modern culture has made them, but as the parables of our age, bringing God's wisdom to a world starved for Truth.
