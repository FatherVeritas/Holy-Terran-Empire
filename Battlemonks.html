    <h2>Who are The Battlemonks?</h2>
	<p>
They are the ultimate warriors of the Galaxy, the crusading orders of the stars. Sworn to guard Christendom, these consecrated knights are bound together by prayer, purity, and discipline, clad in armor and armed to stand as the Church’s sword and shield among the scattered worlds.
	</p>

	<p>
Whether against pirate raids on frontier colonies, or against heresies spreading through drifting settlements, or against alien warbands threatening new missions, the Monastic Military Orders stand their ground. Pilgrims find refuge behind their walls, amd settlers find protectors at their gates.
	</p>

	<p>
Each Order bears its own sacred mission. The Knights of the Holy Star keep watch over the Earthcore systems, and especially over the birthplace of Our Savior, Earth. The Hospitallers of St. Raphael tend the wounded and sick on drifting hospital ships and planets stricken by the plague. The Brethren of Outremer push into wild systems, breaking pirate kingdoms and founding new dioceses where the Church has not yet been able to venture.
	</p>
	
	<p>
To the faithful they are a bulwark; to their foes they are dread incarnate — disciplined, unyielding, feared under the banner of the Cross. And all this, they do not for gold or power, but for the love of Christ and the salvation of souls.
	</p>
	
	<p>
In the vast night between the stars, the Battlemonks endure: a witness that until Christ the King returns, there shall always be those ready to build, to guard, and to fight so that the Cross may stand, unbroken, to the very edge of the galaxy.
