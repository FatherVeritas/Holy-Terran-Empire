    <h2>Who are The Battlemonks?</h2>
	<p>
They are the ultimate warriors of the Galaxy, the crusading orders of the stars. Sworn to guard Christendom, these consecrated knights are bound together by prayer, purity, and discipline, clad in armor and armed to stand as the Church’s sword and shield among the scattered worlds.
	</p>

	<p>
Whether against pirates preying on frontier colonies, or against heresies spreading through drifting settlements, or against alien warbands threatening new missions, the Monastic Military Orders stand their ground. Pilgrims find refuge behind their walls, amd settlers find protectors at their gates.
	</p>

	<p>
Each Order bears its own sacred mission. The Knights of the Holy Star keep watch over the Earthcore systems, and especially over the birthplace of Our Savior, Earth. The Hospitallers of St. Raphael tend the wounded and sick on drifting hospital ships and planets stricken by the plague. The Brethren of Outremer push into wild systems, breaking pirate kingdoms and founding new dioceses where the Church has not yet been able to venture.
	</p>
	
	<p>
To the faithful they are a bulwark; to their foes they are dread incarnate — disciplined, unyielding, feared under the banner of the Cross. And all this, they do not for gold or power, but for the love of Christ and the salvation of souls.
	</p>
	
	<p>
In the vast night between the stars, the Battlemonks endure: a witness that until Christ the King returns, there shall always be those ready to build, to guard, and to fight so that the Cross may stand, unbroken, to the very edge of the galaxy.

  <h2>How The Monks Built Galactic Civilization</h2>
	  <p>

The Battlemonks are a subset of a larger group among the Monastic Orders in general. The Battlemonks, as their name implies, are dedicated to battle, but as monks, they are among those who made the first foray into the stars. In hte bginnings of man's exploration of the Galaxy, among the forefront stood the brave men of the simple monastic orders. Godly men, bound by vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, went with the first settlers to barren planets and half-wild colonies, braving the dark frontiers where few dared to go.
	</p>
	<p>
They did not merely preach the Gospel and baptize the faithful, but made barren worlds hospitable. They cleared toxic growths, terraformed hostile landscapes, and coaxed crops from alien soil. Wherever their monasteries rose — from the windswept plains of border worlds to the frozen edges of mining colonies — they became centers of civilization.
	</p>
	<p>
They preserved the knowledge of Old Earth and carried it into the far reaches of space. Not only the Scriptures and theology, but science, philosophy, and the practical arts. They became teachers and healers, inventors and farmers, and above all, faithful witnesses to the love of Christ.
 	</p>	
	<p>
They opened their doors to any who came — starved settlers, outcasts, alien pilgrims — feeding them, tending their wounds, instructing their children. And when they could not wait for souls to come to them, they went out: venturing into uncharted jungles, negotiating with warlike tribes, and sharing the Gospel with alien races that had never heard the name of Christ.
 	</p>
	<p>
For these monks, the galaxy was not a cold void to be exploited, but a vast garden given by God to be tended and sanctified. Their labor and sacrifice wove the spiritual fabric that binds a scattered humanity and its adopted kin into one Christendom among the stars — a living testament that all this was done not for gold or glory, but out of a love that reaches the ends of the cosmos.

  <h2>Evangelizing the Galaxy</h2>
	  <p> 
The ultimate goal of the Battlemonks is the salvation of souls. But, as there are already many orders dedicated to preaching, and many dangers and evils in the galaxy still unchecked, someone has to be the muscle. That's these guys.
