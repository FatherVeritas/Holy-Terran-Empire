    <h2>What Are Aliens?</h2>
	<p>
Aliens R US. As in, the're human. 99.5% genetically identical to human beings. They can be traced as coming from Earth. That being said, some of them look pretty weird. Tentacles, fins, gills, scales, claws, extra eyes & arms, etc. and so on. But they are all basically humanoid, they are all rational, and they have all been stained with the sin of Adam, and are in need of the saving waters of Baptism.

  <h2>Exohumans</h2>

Aliens are much more properly called 'Exohumans' than aliens. They are human beings, with all the rights and properties thereof, simply not born on Earth, and adapted over many centuries to their home enviroments. Although they look weird, they are still persons, individual substances with rational natures, that are capable of receiving the Beatitic Vision in the next life. Which means they are also moral agents - capable of good and evil. So yes, aliens can be either saints or scumbags. St Glox the Multifarious, pray for us.

  <h2>The Astersion</h2>
	  <p>
ii. The dispersion of these early humans among the stars is called the Astersion, and it's history is recorded in a book called "The Last Son of Adam" describing how, during the great Flood of Noah, one thousand couples, man and woman, were sealed in capsules from the Tree of Life, and wiped off the face of the earth, into the stars, there to await redemption.

<div class="content" id="earth">
  <h2>Earth in the Divine Plan</h2>
	  <p> 
As the birth-planet of our Savior Jesus Christ, Earth is a privileged planet, and a sacred place, but humans born on Earth are in no way superior to anyone born on any other planet. Every race in Galactic Christendom respects the role of Earth in salvation, and its universal liturgical calendar, but also understands that every alien or Exohuman is still a human being, and regardless of race or planet of origin, all are equal in dignity and value before God and Holy Mother Church.
