    <h2>What Are Aliens?</h2>
	<p>
Aliens, more properly called Exohumans, are descended from the race of Adam, having spread among the stars in a galactic event known as the Astersion. Over thousands of years, they developed many different external characteristics based upon the conditions of their individual home planets- tentacles, claws, gills, extra eyes, textured or patterend skin, and so on. Yet all remain 99% genetically compatible with human beings from Earth, and more importantly, identical in terms of the soul. Every alien in the galaxy is a person - an individual substance of a rational nature, with all the rights and properties thereof. Every alien is a moral agent, capable of good and evil, stained with Original Sin and in need of the saving waters of Baptism.

  <h2>The Astersion</h2>
	  <p>
The ancient dispersion of humanity among the stars is called the Astersion, and it's history is recorded in a book called "The Last Son of Adam". This book describes, among many other fascinating details about the origin and early history of man, how during the great Flood of Noah, one thousand couples, man and woman, were placed into capsules carved from the Tree of Life. These capsules were then sealed with sap from the very same tree, and wiped off the face of Earth into the stars, there to await redemption. These couples were not so wicked as to deserve destruction, but not righteous enough to be saved with Noah. Their descendents have waited many long centuries on distant planets, remembering the old stories, and awaiting their coming savior.

  <h2>Earth in the Divine Plan</h2>
	  <p> 
As the birth-planet of our Savior Jesus Christ, Earth is a privileged planet and a sacred place, but humans born on Earth are in no way superior to those born on different planets. Every race in Galactic Christendom respects the role of Earth in salvation history, as well as its universal liturgical calendar, but also understands that every alien or Exohuman is still a human being, and regardless of race or planet of origin, all are equal in dignity and value before God and Holy Mother Church.
