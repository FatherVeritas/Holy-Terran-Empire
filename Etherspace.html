    <h2>What is Etherspace?</h2>
	<p>Etherspace is a fourth dimension of physical space, where matter can exist and move in ways, and at speeds, that surpass our current 
understanding of physics, making faster than light travel possible. 
It is the realm into which the Resurrected body will be taken by the soul, the realm through which Christ passed when He ascended into heaven. 
The ultimate terminus of Etherspace is heaven itself – and just as heaven must be a real, physical place, since our resurrected bodies will dwell 
there – so too is Etherspace, since our resurrected bodies will be traveling through it. 
	</p>

	<p> In the Resurrection, the soul will be able to move the glorified body across vast distances almost instantaneously. 
Like the angels, the soul is unbounded by physical matter or place; it can be present wherever it wills by its power of attention. 
In our present state of fallen human nature, the soul’s powers are limited by the body; but after the Resurrection, the body will fully 
share in the freedom of the soul. Therefore, this physical medium – this mysterious realm through which the glorified body will travel – is called Ether, or Etherspace. 
	</p>

	<p>Traveling within Etherspace can somewhat be described like descending into greater depths of an ocean. 
The deeper one enters into Etherspace, the faster travel becomes. But with each layer, navigation becomes more difficult and demanding. 
The deepest reaches of Etherspace remain inaccessible to machines or unglorified bodies, but even the shallower layers can carry the vessels of man across the vast distances of the galaxy, at speeds that can reach, in some cases, hundreds of times faster than the speed of light. This is what makes Galactic travel possible, 
and what enables civilization to spread across the stars.

  <h2>Navigating Etherspace</h2>
  <p>
 Skilled navigators chart the shifting currents of Etherspace, reading its resonance
 frequencies and anomalies. The art of navigation requires great attention and precise attunement to both the spiritual and physical worlds.

<div class="content" id="aetherite">
  <h2>Aetherite</h2>
  <p>
	Aetherite is the crystalline substance that resonates with the flows of Etherspace.
        It powers the shift drives and the resonance chambers that enable ships to transition
        between physical space and the Ether. It is formed on Asteroids by Etherdrift deposits.

<div class="content" id="ocean">
  <h2>The Ocean of Deep Space</h2>
  <p> 
	Etherspace is like the infinite Ocean of deep space — a mysterious dimension
        where the boundaries between ohysics and metaphysics blur. It
        is close to the veil of heaven itself.
