    <h2>What is Etherspace?</h2>
	<p>Etherspace is a real, physical realm – the fourth dimension of space. 
It is the realm into which the Resurrected body can be taken by the soul, and the realm through which Christ passed when He ascended into heaven. 
The ultimate terminus of Etherspace is heaven itself – and just as heaven must be a real, physical place, since our resurrected bodies will dwell 
there – so too is Etherspace, since our resurrected bodies will be traveling through it. 
	</p>

	<p> In the Resurrection, the soul will be able to move the glorified body across vast distances almost instantaneously. 
Such rapid movement is not a miracle of God, imparted from outside, but a natural ability proper to the soul itself. 
Like the angels, the soul is unbounded by physical matter or place; it can be present wherever it wills by its power of attention. 
In our present state of fallen human nature, the soul’s powers are limited by the body; but after the Resurrection, the body will fully 
share in the freedom of the soul. 
	</p>

	<p>Therefore, this physical medium – this mysterious realm through which the glorified body will travel – is called Ether, or Etherspace. 
It is another dimension of physical space where matter can exist and move in ways, and at speeds, that surpass our current 
understanding of physics. While the realm of Etherspace will only fully be accessible in the next life, it can even how in this life 
be accessed and partially utilized, and is what makes faster than light travel possible. 
	</p>

	<p>Etherspace could not be discovered or unlocked through quantum mechanics or the theory of relativity. 
These frameworks, while powerful in their own limited domains, could not account for the ordered, metaphysical reality that Etherspace 
reveals and indeed depends upon. Instead, its structure is better approached through the lens of classical physics, as represented by 
thinkers like Leibniz, who recognized the universe as a continuous, hierarchical, and harmoniously ordered whole. 
Only through this more integrated, philosophical understanding can Etherspace be perceived and interacted with. 
	</p>

	<p>Traveling within Etherspace can somewhat be described like descending into greater depths of an ocean. 
The deeper one enters into Etherspace, the faster travel becomes. But with each layer, navigation becomes more difficult and demanding. 
The deepest reaches of Etherspace are inaccessible to machines or unglorified bodies; they belong to the soul and the resurrected body alone. 
At that point, movement becomes instantaneous, for the soul sees the whole of the universe in a single act of vision — and where the soul sees, 
the body can go. Until such a time, mankind makes use of the Ether for traveling across the vast distances of the galaxy, 
at speeds that can reach, in some cases, hundreds of times faster than the speed of light. This is what makes Galactic travel possible, 
and for civilization to spread across the stars.
